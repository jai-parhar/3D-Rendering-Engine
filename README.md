# 3D Rendering Engine
A small exploration into an OpenGL based 3D raster-based rendering engine. This code is a few years old now and no longer in active development, but is useful as a sandbox to test out new ideas, as well as a potential starting point for a future, more expansive 3D engine. This will likely not recieve direct updates but I have placed it here for posterity.

Current features include:
- Procedural animation (currently in the form of a sword swinging)
- Post-processing effects and screenspace effects such as gaussian blurring and colour inversion
- Entity component system
- Mesh loading via .obj files as well as a custom mesh file format
- Game state system
